## Overview

### The Challenge

Explore countries around the world with detailed information and a smooth, responsive design. Toggle between light and dark modes for a personalized experience.

Users should be able to:

- View all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more details on a separate page
- Navigate to neighboring countries from the details page
- Toggle between light and dark mode

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for theming

### What I Learned

- Fetching and displaying data from an API efficiently
- Implementing a responsive UI with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Creating a theme switcher to toggle between light and dark modes
- Enhancing user experience with search and filter functionality
- Handling state management effectively with React Hooks

Following code snippet helped me understand the significance of :focus in CSS:

```css
.input-form select {
    margin-right: 3em;
    margin-top: 3em;
    padding: 1em;
    border: none;
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px -5px var(--shadowColor);
    color: var(--textColor);
    background-color: var(--headerColor);
    font-family: 'Nunito Sans', sans-serif;
}

.input-form select:focus,
.input-form input:focus {
    outline: none;
}
```

### Continued Development

I plan to improve and expand on this project by:

- Adding more advanced filtering options
- Enhancing performance for faster loading times
- Implementing a bookmarking feature to save favorite countries
- Improving accessibility and UX design
